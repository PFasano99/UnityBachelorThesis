# EnviromentalSimulation

This project is my bachelor's degree thesis project. 
The objective of this thesis project is to show how the implementation of new technologies  dedicated to the understanding of errors and dangers signs inside an heavy machinary, can make the resolution of problems and the difficulty of facing problems present on the vehicle more accessible to the vehicle operator. More precisely, the objective is to create a simulation that allows the user to learn the meaning of the danger and error signs and decals.
